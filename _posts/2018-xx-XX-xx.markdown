Other VMs of this series can be downloaded from [VulnHub] too.\\
Go check them out - there`re awesome!

# Enumeration
As we boot the VM in `bridged mode` there is an output on the console which shows us the IP address of the VM:`192.168.0.11`. \\
First, we start with an `nmap` scan to check for any open ports.

- `-sC: equivalent to --script=default`
- `-sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info`
- `-O: Enable OS detection`
